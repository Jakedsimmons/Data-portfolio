# Project 1: Portsmouth NHS Spend Analysis

Analysing spending over £25,000 by Portsmouth Hospitals University NHS Trust using open data.

## Goals
- Identify top suppliers
- Explore monthly spending pattenrs
- Visualise expense categories

## Results
I found that the largest contribution to monthly spending is operational and insurance costs, both being more than double that of other suppliers. After eliminating these top two suppliers I found that the next highest ranked monthly expense is current non-NHS payables; payment installments towards transactions not yet fulfilled. With about 30% of total spending (not including operational and insurance costs) it is in the clear lead, above other suppliers of other products or services such as private contractors from the commercial sector, Public Dividend Capital (PDC) charges owed/paid to the Department of Health, and computer maintenance and software.
